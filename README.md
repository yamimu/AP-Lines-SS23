``` cmd
python -m lines.visulatization.mainWindow
```

## Package structure

The second is 'optimization' containing implementations of the dijkstra algorithm and the floydWarshall algorithm as well as the following functions: best_start_point; best_start_node_index; construct_path; 

The third part being 'visualization' containing the functions to play the game
